## Rolling Combinations

### Quick Scene: 1 Roll
- Location + NPC → A scene setting with a character problem

### Short Session: 2-3 Rolls
- NPC + Rumor + Complication → A social puzzle
- Location + Event + Faction → A political introduction

## Reading the Tables

### Entry Format
Each entry is designed to be:

**Specific** (not generic)
```
✅ "A carpenter who's been subtly sabotaging buildings"
❌ "A carpenter with a secret"
```

**Implicative** (generates questions)
```
"This is a person—why are they doing this? What happens when it's discovered?"
```

**Immediately Usable**
```
"I can drop this NPC into the game right now and they bring conflict with them"
```

**Short & Punchy** (1-2 lines)
```
"Readable at a glance, customizable in play"
```

## Common Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: "Give Me a Problem"
**Roll**: Complications + Event  
**Example**: Event says "a merchant fleet is lost," Complication says "success requires an enemy's help"  
**Result**: The party must work with someone they don't trust to salvage a situation

### Pattern 2: "Give Me an NPC"
**Roll**: NPCs with Hidden Stakes  
**Example**: "A merchant whose entire wealth is counterfeit"  
**Result**: Quest-giver who seems reliable but carries a ticking time bomb

### Pattern 3: "Make This Place Interesting"
**Roll**: Location + Environmental Details + Rumor  
**Example**: Location is a marketplace on unstable ground; Detail is sealed windows; Rumor is embezzlement  
**Result**: A town with obvious problems and hidden ones, ready for investigation

### Pattern 4: "I Need an Investigation"
**Roll**: Mystery + Rumor + Faction  
**Example**: Mystery (theft that never happened), Rumor (someone framed), Faction (with contradictory goals)  
**Result**: A puzzle where solving it helps different factions differently

### Pattern 5: "How Does This Change?"
**Roll**: Event + Complication + Faction  
**Example**: Political shift forces alliance, complication makes that alliance costly, faction has members who disagree  
**Result**: The party watches a power structure fracture differently based on who they support

## Tips for GMs Using These Tables

### Use Them as Frameworks, Not Scripts
- Roll "A scholar hoarding banned books"
- Customize: What books? Why banned? Who would pay for them?
- Adapt: Scholar could be ally, antagonist, or source of complications

### Combine Strategically, Not Randomly
- Rolling "roll 5 random entries" = chaos
- Rolling "an NPC hook for this location" = useful
- Rolling "a complication if the party refuses the obvious solution" = perfect friction

### Let Tables Surprise You
- If you roll something weird, lean into it
- "The captain recruits by testing soldiers against a specific crime—wait, what crime?"
- That question becomes the story

### Use Weight Distribution
- When you roll twice, the 2x-weight entries appear more often
- This surfaces the most complicated/interesting options
- But you can ignore weight and just pick what sounds useful

### Remix Entries
- Combine two NPCs: "hoarding books AND secretly training disciples"
- Cross-pollinate tables: "Item that has Environmental Detail attached to it"
- Extend mysteries: "Use the NPC as the mystery's center"

## What These Tables DON'T Do

❌ Generate random combat encounters (use combat generators for that)  
❌ Give you complete statistics (tables give framework, you customize)  
❌ Replace campaign planning (tables are inspiration, not blueprints)  
❌ Solve social problems (they create them—players solve them)

## What These Tables DO Do

✅ Create immediate, usable complications  
✅ Generate non-generic hooks that spark questions  
✅ Provide frameworks for customization  
✅ Model good worldbuilding (specificity + implication)  
✅ Support improvisation at the table  
✅ Create moral complexity, not just obstacles

## Difficulty Scaling

### Easy Difficulty
- Use NPCs, Locations, Details as flavor
- Rumors are mostly false
- Mysteries resolve with straightforward investigation
- **Tone**: "Here's a fun place to adventure"

### Medium Difficulty
- Use Complications, Events, Factions as introduced tension
- Rumors are partially true, complicating situations
- Mysteries require choosing between imperfect solutions
- **Tone**: "Nothing's simple, but solvable"

### Hard Difficulty
- Use all tables together, creating cascading problems
- Rumors and mysteries contradict each other
- Complications force alliance with enemies
- Events change what the party is working toward
- **Tone**: "Every choice creates new problems"

## Compatibility Notes

### Works Well With:
- Story-focused campaigns
- Intrigue-heavy games
- Moral ambiguity systems
- Improvisation-heavy play
- Investigation-focused narratives

### Less Compatible With:
- Dungeon crawls (no combat encounters)
- Purely mercenary campaigns (assumes some stakes)
- Fully scripted campaigns (tables need flexibility)
- One-shot tactical battles (focus is on narrative tension)

### To Adapt For Other Genres:
- **Sci-Fi**: Replace locations/factions with stations/corporations, items with tech
- **Urban Fantasy**: Use factions as cabals, items as magical tech, NPCs as modern professionals
- **Horror**: Complications become environmental threats, mysteries stay similar, NPCs become survival problems
- **Western**: Factions become settler/native/outlaw groups, items become specific weapons/tools

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

### Mistake 1: "I rolled it, so I must use it exactly"
**Fix**: Tables are inspiration. Customize everything.

### Mistake 2: "This doesn't fit my campaign setting"
**Fix**: Extract the core tension and reskin. "Merchant playing both sides of war" becomes "space captain dealing with both empire factions."

### Mistake 3: "Rolling doesn't feel natural in my game"
**Fix**: Roll in prep, don't roll at the table. Tables are tools, not performance props.

### Mistake 4: "Players ignored the hook completely"
**Fix**: That's fine. The table generated possibilities, not a script. The real adventure is what they chose to do instead.

### Mistake 5: "This complication solved the problem too fast"
**Fix**: Good—now introduce another complication. Tables are tools for continuous escalation.

## Rolling Rituals (Optional Fun)

### Three-Table Method
Roll from three different tables, describe how they relate:
- NPC + Location + Event
- "The scholar is there because the location's problem just occurred"
- "Now there's a hook"

### Escalation Roll
Roll once, get a scene. If it goes static, roll a Complication mid-scene.
```
Roll 1: Location
→ Players explore, find the interesting part
Roll 2: Complication
→ Now it's dangerous/complex
Roll 3: Mystery or Event
→ Now it matters beyond this scene
```

### Faction Opposition Roll
Roll for an NPC ally, then roll a Faction, then determine how they conflict.
```
"The scholar allies with the party, but serves a faction with contradictory goals"
→ Tension created by alignment, not enemy combat
```

## Sharing & Adaptation

These tables are designed to be:
- **Remixed**: Take entries, combine them, make them your own
- **Expanded**: Add entries following the same anti-generic philosophy
- **Adapted**: Reskin for different genres and settings
- **Simplified**: Use just the parts that fit your game

The design philosophy is more valuable than the specific entries—once you see how they work, you can create better tables for your own campaign.

## Quick-Start: Your First Roll

1. Pick a table that matches what you need
2. Roll a number from 1-10 (or 1-9 for some)
3. Read the entry out loud
4. Ask yourself: "What question does this raise?"
5. Spend 2 minutes customizing it for your world
6. Use it

That's it. Tables are tools, not destiny.
